## Key Features

- Standard version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Supports pre-release versions with MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-PRERELEASE format (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1)

## üõ† Installation

Download Binary from [releases page](https://github.com/adharshmk96/semver/releases) and move it to `/usr/local/bin` or any `PATH` directory.


or

With Golang

```bash
go install github.com/adharshmk96/semver@latest
```

If you're facing with issues, Ensure go is setup and check GOPATH is in PATH configurations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### `semver init <version>`

For new projects, run `semver init` to initialize the project. Optionally specify the initial version number.

```bash
semver init
```

or

```bash
semver init v1.0.0
```

> NOTE: You don't need to initialize if you're managing semver already with git tags.


### `semver get`

To get the current version of the project, run `semver get`.

```bash
semver get
```

## üìñ Managing Versions

### Release Versions

`semver major | minor | patch `

Increments the corresponding release version number by 1. 

example: 

```bash
semver major    # v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0
semver minor    # v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0
semver patch    # v1.0.0 -> v1.0.1
```

To attach a pre-release version, add `--[ alpha | beta | rc ]` flag.

example: 

```bash
semver major --alpha    # v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0-alpha.1
semver major --beta     # v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0-beta.1
semver major --rc       # v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0-rc.1
```

### Pre-Release Versions

`semver alpha | beta | rc`

Increments the corresponding pre-release version number by 1.

example: 

```bash
semver alpha # v1.0.0-alpha.1 -> v1.0.0-alpha.2
semver beta  # v1.0.0-beta.1 -> v1.0.0-beta.2
semver rc    # v1.0.0-rc.1 -> v1.0.0-rc.2
```

> Note: You can't run pre-release update to current release version. (ie) `semver alpha` will fail if the current version is `v1.0.0`. You have to create pre-release like for example: `semver major --alpha`.

### Remove Pre-Release

`semver release`

Removes the pre-release tag from the current version.

example: 

```bash
semver release # v1.0.0-alpha.2 -> v1.0.0
```

## üìù Other Commands

### `semver untag <tag>`

Removes the specified tag from the git repository.

```bash
semver untag v1.0.0
```

### `semver reset`

Resets the version to specified version or `v0.0.1` ( default ).

```bash
semver reset v1.0.0 # v1.2.3 -> v1.0.0
semver reset        # v1.2.3 -> v0.0.1
```

Note: Always ensure you understand the implications of each command, especially ones like `reset`. Misuse can lead to data loss.
