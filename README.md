# `semver` - Semantic Version Management CLI Tool

`semver` is a command-line interface tool designed to simplify and streamline the management of your project's semantic versioning. It uses a `.version.yaml` file to store the project's current version and also uses git tags for version management. When updating the version, `semver` will also tag the git repository with the new version.

| Command             | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get`               | Retrieve and display the current version of the project.                                                                                                                  |
| `help`              | Provides detailed information and guidance on any specified command.                                                                                                      |
| `init`              | Kickstarts `semver` by initializing the necessary configuration. This includes the creation of the `.version.yaml` file. ( optionally add version )                       |
| `push`              | Pushes the current version of the project to the git repository. This helps in keeping the repository synchronized with version changes.                                  |
| `reset`             | ‚ö†Ô∏è (Use with caution) Wipes out all existing git tags and deletes the semver configuration. When used with `-r` or `--remote`, this also affects the remote repository.    |
| `untag`             | Removes a specified git tag. If no tag is specified, the current tag is deleted by default. Using `-r` or `--remote` will also delete the tag from the remote repository. |
| `up <version-type>` | Elevates the semver version by a single increment, adhering to semantic versioning standards. `version-type: <major/minor/patch/alpha/beta/rc>`                           |
| `version`           | Displays the running version of the `semver` CLI tool itself.                                                                                                             |
